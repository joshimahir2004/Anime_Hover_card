                    massive walls that stopped the giants in their tracks. But the safety they have had for so long is
                    threatened when a colossal Titan smashes through the barriers, causing a flood of the giants into
                    what had been the humans' safe zone. During the carnage that follows, soldier Eren Jaeger sees one
                    of the creatures devour his mother, which leads him to vow that he will kill every Titan. He enlists
                    some friends who survived to help him, and that group is humanity's last hope for avoiding
                    extinction at the hands of the monsters.</p>
